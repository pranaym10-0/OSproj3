a. Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session? 
It is alright for this par to be empty if there have been no new developments between session, but you should try to fill it in when you can. 
I haven't started developing due to studying for my finals and working on project for another class. However I will start now.

b. What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What do you plan to change? 
What do you plan to implement next? What is your goal for this session?
I plan to get everything done the best I can in the limited time I have left. I started "coding" earlier today but forgot I need to make a devlog. I just had an outline of what I needed to do.

a. I made good progress I just didn't think about documenting it like I should've been. 
b. I need to implement the load, print, and extract commands to ensure the program meets all requirements.

Haven't had much time to work on code until today but it is now done.  I was struggling to implement the load, print, and extract commands, but I got it to work eventually. Everything should work as intended. Had a loop issue but I fixed that as well.
